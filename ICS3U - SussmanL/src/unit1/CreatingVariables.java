		Variables
		- A variable is a place in memory that you can tell your computer to set aside when you make a program.
		- This location can be used to store a piece of information.
		- You can give this location a name
		- You can change the information that the location holds.
		- You can recall the value of this memory location later and use in different parts of your program

		A variable be:
		 *declared* (Necessary) - you're telling the computer that you need to keep a value, and the computer will create a space in memory for it

		ie.
		int myNum; //you are declaring a variable called myNum that stores an int type of data

		 *initialized*(Necessary) - in order to use the variable, you first need to give it an initial value. Otherwise, the computer won't be able to do something with the variable

		myNum = 10; //initializes the value of myNum to 10, so I can use it in other ways

		 *assigned* - similar to initialize, that you're setting the value of the variable to another value

		myNum = 20; //I've changed the value of myNum

		Once your variable has been given a value, it can then be *referenced* - that is, it can be used by its name
