    Create a program that demonstrates the use of .equals(), .equalsIgnoreCase(), .compareTo().  You should be using if statements for this program.
    Also, include an example of explicit and implicit casting.

    Comment to explain:
      -when you use the different String functions
      -when you are casting and how the value is changed
